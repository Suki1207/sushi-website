<h1>Sushi-Inspired Website</h1>

<p>The Sushi-Inspired Website project began as a follow-along tutorial with Adrian from <a href="https://github.com/adrianhajdin">JS Mastery</a>, but I have since rebuilt it multiple times from scratch, internalizing the concepts and confidently applying them independently. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, light JavaScript, and the BEM methodology.</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>This project marks a significant milestone in my front-end development journey. It provided hands-on experience with essential tools and technologies. Through this project, I honed advanced CSS skills, such as structuring entire sections using flexboxes and integrating contained background images, among other techniques and implementing the BEM methodology.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Utilization of HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive website.</li>
  <li>Implementation of the BEM methodology for cleaner code.</li>
  <li>Mastery of advanced CSS techniques, including flexbox layout and background image manipulation.</li>
  <li>Integration of essential front-end principles to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
